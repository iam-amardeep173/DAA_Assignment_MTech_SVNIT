1. Parenthesize String Algorithm:
	This program determines whether it is possible to parenthesize a given string of symbols to obtain the sequence 'a' using a stack-based approach.

2. Algorithm Overview:
	The algorithm uses a stack to process each symbol in the input string. It iterates through the symbols and checks whether they can
	be paired based on a predefined pairing rule. The pairing rule is defined as follows:

	'a' pairs with 'b'
	'b' pairs with 'c'
	'c' pairs with 'a'
	The program uses a stack to keep track of the symbols and their pairing relationships. If a symbol can pair with the top symbol of the stack, it updates the stack accordingly. 
	The final result is determined by checking if the stack contains only one element, and that element is 'a'.

3. Algorithm Complexity:
    3.1.Time Complexity
	The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The program iterates through each symbol once, 
	and the stack operations take constant time.

    3.2.Space Complexity
	The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string. In the worst case, the stack may contain all symbols of the input string.

4. Empirical Analysis:
	Enter the string of symbols: ab
	Yes, it is possible to parenthesize the string to get 'a'.
	Time taken: 458 microseconds

	Enter the string of symbols: ababcaa
	No, it is not possible to parenthesize the string to get 'a'.
	Time taken: 611 microseconds

	Enter the string of symbols: abbccab
	No, it is not possible to parenthesize the string to get 'a'.
	Time taken: 1093 microseconds

5. Conclusion
	The program provides a simple and efficient solution to the problem of checking if a given string can be parenthesized according to a specific pairing rule. 
	The algorithm's time complexity is linear, making it suitable for a wide range of input sizes.
