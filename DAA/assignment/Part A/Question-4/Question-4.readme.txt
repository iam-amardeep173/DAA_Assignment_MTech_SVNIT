Program File : Question-4.cpp
How to run the program: Open Command Prompt/Powershell
                        Go to the folder using cd
                        Run the following command to compile the cpp file
Command to compile and run the program : Command to run program : g++ -o Question-4 Question-4.cpp&Question-4.exe

    1.The program performs the following steps:
	1. Generates a dataset of random integers with a specified size.
	2. Creates a copy of the dataset and sorts it using the C++ `sort` function for comparison purposes.
	3. Applies the following sorting algorithms to both the unsorted and sorted datasets:
  	   - Insertion Sort
   	   - Merge Sort
  	   - Quick Sort
  	   - Heap Sort
	4. Counts and reports the number of swaps performed by each sorting algorithm on both unsorted and sorted data.


    2. Asymptotic Analysis of Time Complexity
        Insertion Sort:
	  Average Case: O(N^2)
          Best Case (already sorted): O(N)
	Merge Sort:
	  Average Case: O(N log N)
	Quick Sort:
	  Average Case: O(N log N)
	  Worst Case (if not optimized): O(N^2)
	Heap Sort:
	  Average Case: O(N log N)

     3. Empirical Analysis of Time Complexity
        Testing on unsorted data:      
	Insertion Sort - Unsorted Data:
	Swaps: -1789052376
	Merge Sort - Unsorted Data:
	Swaps: 0
	Quick Sort - Unsorted Data:
	Swaps: 1559542658
	Heap Sort - Unsorted Data:
	Swaps: 1548050

	Testing on sorted data:      
	Insertion Sort - Sorted Data:
	Swaps: 0
	Merge Sort - Sorted Data:
	Swaps: 0
	Quick Sort - Sorted Data:
	Swaps: 1559542658
	Heap Sort - Sorted Data:
	Swaps: 1548050
        The program will output the number of swaps performed by each sorting algorithm on both unsorted and sorted datasets.
