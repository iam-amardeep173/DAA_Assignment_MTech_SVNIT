To output the execution time in microseconds in your C++ program:

Measure Time in Microseconds:

Use a timer before and after executing the code you want to measure.
Record the current time before starting the code execution.
Record the current time again after the code execution is complete.
Calculate the time difference between the two recorded times.
Convert to Microseconds:

Convert the time difference into microseconds (1 second = 1,000,000 microseconds) using appropriate conversions or libraries, such as <chrono> in C++.
Display Time in Microseconds:

Print the calculated time in microseconds as part of your program's output.
pseudo-code:-
start_time = get_current_time() // Record the start time
execute_code_to_measure() // Run the code you want to measure
end_time = get_current_time() // Record the end time

// Calculate the time difference in microseconds
time_difference = end_time - start_time

// Display the time in microseconds
print("Time taken: " + time_difference + " microseconds")
