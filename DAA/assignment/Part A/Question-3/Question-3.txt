    1.Duplicate Removal Program
	This program generates a dataset of random integers, removes duplicates, measures the time taken for the removal process, and saves a portion of the dataset to a text file.

	*Program Description
	    The program performs the following steps:
		1. Generates a dataset of random integers with a specified size.
		2. Identifies and removes duplicate values from the dataset while preserving the order of the original elements.
		3. Measures the time taken to remove duplicates and counts the number of duplicates removed.
                4. Saves a portion of the dataset to a text file named "data.txt."


    2. Time Complexity
        Generating the random dataset of size N: O(N)
	Removing duplicates from the dataset of size N: O(N) in the average case, as it involves iterating through the dataset once. 
	However, in the worst case (if there are no duplicates), it is still O(N).

     3. Empirical Analysis of Time Complexity
        Time taken to remove duplicates: 2021753 microseconds
	Number of duplicates removed: 212

     4. Files
	 main.cpp: The main C++ source code file.
	 data.txt: Text file containing a portion of the generated dataset.
