    1.Duplicate Removal Program
	This program generates a dataset of random integers, removes duplicates, and measures the time taken for the removal process.

	*Program Description
	    The program performs the following steps:
		1. Generates a dataset of random integers with a specified size.
		2. Identifies and removes duplicate values from the dataset while preserving the order of the original elements.
		3. Measures the time taken to remove duplicates and counts the number of duplicates removed.


    2. Time Complexity
        Generating the random dataset of size N: O(N)
	Removing duplicates from the dataset of size N: O(N) in the average case, as it involves iterating through the dataset once. 
	However, in the worst case (if there are no duplicates), it is still O(N).

     3. Empirical Analysis of Time Complexity
        Time taken to remove duplicates: 2073400 microseconds
        Number of duplicates removed: 242
