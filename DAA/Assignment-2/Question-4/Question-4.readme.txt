    1.## Activity Selection Algorithm

        This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of activity selection using the "Greedy Algorithm". The goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
          
         ## Algorithm Explanation
                The algorithm works as follows:
                  1. Sort activities based on their finish times.
                  2. Initialize an empty list for selected activities.
                  3. Add the first activity to the list.
                  4. For each remaining activity, if its start time is greater than or equal to the finish time of the previously selected activity, add it to the list.
                  5. Finally, print the selected activities.

	

    2. Time Complexity
        The time complexity of the Activity Selection Algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. Here's a breakdown of the time complexity:
        Sorting activities: O(n log n)
        Finding non-overlapping activities: O(n)
        The dominating factor is the sorting step, resulting in O(n log n) as the overall time complexity.

     3.#Output
       Selected activities are:      
	Start time: 1, Finish time: 4 
	Start time: 5, Finish time: 7 
	Start time: 8, Finish time: 11
