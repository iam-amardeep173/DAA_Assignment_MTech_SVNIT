*** Huffman coding ***

** Overview **
	This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm. 
	Huffman coding is a data compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to characters in such a way that more frequent characters are assigned shorter codes, reducing the overall size of the encoded data.

** Algorithm Complexity **
	The Huffman coding algorithm's complexity can be analyzed as follows:
  Time Complexity:
	Building the frequency map: O(n), where n is the length of the input text.
	Building the priority queue: O(k * log(k)), where k is the number of unique characters.
	Building the Huffman tree: O(k * log(k)) as well, where k is the number of unique characters.
	Encoding the text: O(n), where n is the length of the input text.
	Decoding the text: O(n), where n is the length of the encoded text.
	Overall time complexity: O(n + k * log(k))

  Space Complexity:
	Storing the frequency map: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters.
	Storing the priority queue: O(k).
	Storing the Huffman tree: O(k).
	Overall space complexity: O(k)

** Asymptotic Analysis **
	The asymptotic analysis of the Huffman coding algorithm suggests that its time complexity is O(n + k * log(k)), where n is the length of the input text, and k is the number of unique characters. 
	This analysis implies that the algorithm's efficiency increases with a larger input text size and a larger number of unique characters.
