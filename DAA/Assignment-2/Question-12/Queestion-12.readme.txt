*** Euler Circuit Finder ***

** Overview **
	This C++ program is designed to find an Euler circuit in a directed graph.
	 An Euler circuit is a path that visits every edge of a graph exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.

** Algorithm Complexity **
	The algorithm used in this program is based on Hierholzer's algorithm for finding Eulerian circuits in a directed graph. 

	The algorithm's complexity can be analyzed as follows:
	Time Complexity: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because we visit each edge once.
	Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(V + E) due to the use of data structures such as vectors to store the adjacency lists and stacks to keep track of the circuit.

** Asymptotic Analysis **
	The time complexity of O(V + E) implies that the algorithm's running time increases linearly with the number of vertices and edges in the graph. 
	This is an efficient algorithm for finding Euler circuits, and it can handle large graphs with many vertices and edges without significant performance issues.
