*** Petrol Station Road Trip Solver ***

** Overview **
	This C++ program helps you find the optimal petrol stations to stop at for a road trip from your starting point to New Delhi. 
        Given a list of petrol stations along the route, their distances from the starting point, the petrol available at each station, 
        and the maximum tank capacity of your car, the program calculates the most efficient stops to ensure you reach your destination.

** Algorithm Complexity **
	The core of this program is a simple greedy algorithm that iterates through the list of petrol stations and makes decisions at each station. 

	The complexity of the algorithm is as follows:
    **Time Complexity: O(n)**
        The program iterates through the list of petrol stations once, where 'n' is the number of petrol stations.
    **Space Complexity: O(1)**
        The space used by the program is constant and does not depend on the number of petrol stations.

** Asymptotic Analysis **
	The program's time complexity is linear (O(n)), which means that the time it takes to find the optimal petrol stations increases linearly with the number of petrol stations. 
	This is efficient for small to moderately large datasets.

** OUTPUT **
Enter the number of petrol stations: 4 
Enter the distance and petrol available at each station:
100 20
300 5
400 30
200 25
Enter the maximum tank capacity of the car: 150
Optimal petrol stations to stop at: 100
